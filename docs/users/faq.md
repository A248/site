Over the years, we've been asked many of the same questions by users.
This FAQ attempts to answer as many of these questions from the user
perspective.

## What version of Java does Velocity require?

Velocity requires Java 8 as a minimum. We recommend using Java 11.

## Does Velocity support plugins developed for BungeeCord or Waterfall?

No. Many of the things Velocity can do could not be done if we decided
to support BungeeCord plugins.

However, certain plugins may have Velocity ports available or alternatives
are available. In addition, plugins that support BungeeCord but only require
that they are installed on the server (nothing on the proxy) typically use
the BungeeCord plugin messaging channel, which can be supported by BungeeQuack
for Velocity 1.0.x or natively by Velocity 1.1.0.
